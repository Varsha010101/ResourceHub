# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome!

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our open-source project. Whether you're new to open source or an experienced developer, we want your contributions to be smooth and enjoyable. Below, you'll find some guidelines and tips to help you get started.

Please adhere to and review our [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/jfmartinz/ResourceHub/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Important Rules

To ensure a smooth experience, please follow these important rules:

1. **Relevance:** Ensure that the resource you're adding aligns with the appropriate category. Web development resources belong in the web development category, UI/UX design resources in the UI/UX design category, and so forth. Additionally, ensure that your resource aligns with the specific section of the category. For example, if you have a resource named ["anime.js"](https://animejs.com/), it should be placed in the [web development](https://github.com/jfmartinz/ResourceHub/tree/main/Web%20Development) category under the [animation](https://github.com/jfmartinz/ResourceHub/tree/main/Web%20Development#animations) section. This precision ensures that users can easily locate and benefit from the resources in their intended context.
2. **Use the PR Template:** When you create a pull request (PR), please make sure to carefully follow and review the provided PR template. This ensures a structured and efficient collaboration process.

### How to Add a Resource

   **URL Format**: When adding a resource, follow this format:

   ```markdown
   <a href="URL_here">Resource Name</a>
   ```
Example:
   ```markdown
   ### Section name
 <table width="100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Resource Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="URL HERE">RESOURCE NAME</a></td>
      <td>RESOURCE DESCRIPTION</td>
    </tr>
</table>
   ```

   > Note: Replace "URL_here" with the actual resource URL and provide a brief description.

   By following these rules, you will help maintain consistency and clarity in our repository.
